# Snowdog Front-end Recruitment test

* Please do not use fake Github accounts, we want to check your contributions history since we use and create open source.
* Remember to commit changes after every task.
* We are not answering any questions about this test. Everyone work with the same set of information, to let us fairly judge your work.
* If you think that some part of this test is weirdly old-fashioned or not described precisely, there is a very high chance it's done on purpose, because we want to test you in a way worse environment than you will work on a daily basis.

## Before you start
Fork this repository, it needs to stay on Github, available for everyone.

The test is based on [Google Web Starter Kit](https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit) v0.6.5

Follow [installation instructions](https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit/blob/v0.6.5/docs/install.md) and read [commands](https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit/blob/v0.6.5/docs/commands.md) documentation to set up developer tools. You should end with a working test page on http://localhost:3000/.

---

### Task 1
Add [this repo](https://github.com/SnowdogApps/front-end-recruitment-test-submodule) as submodule at `/submodule` folder, then run gulp task `submodule` to add symlink. (If in Windows, run terminal in admin mode)

[Here](http://localhost:3000/submodule.html) you should see a beautiful page with slices of fried bacon.

Add JS to clone bacon image and attach this action to **Yeah, I want more bacon!** button.

### Task 2
Add tab **Checkout** that reflects design from `/projects/checkout.png`.

Use SCSS to write your styles.

### Task 3
Add simple JS validation to checkout form created earlier and show success/error message on form submit.
